 <summary>Quick start</summary>
Connect power to the board via terminal block labeled J17 as shown in the image below.
<p align="center"><img width="30%" src="https://github.com/blinky-iot/Blink-board/blob/main/images/power%20connection.jpeg?raw=true"><br>
<em>_+ve wire to go to the +24V mark and -ve wire to be connected to the GND mark._</em>
</p>
<p>The recommended input voltage range is 5V-24V.<br>
Led D58 and D59 on the main board will come on to indicate that the board is receiving 4.2V and 3.3V respectively.<br>
Make sure that you have installed arduino IDE in your computer. Read more on <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing/">arduino IDE installation</a><br>
clone the blink board repository in any prefered location on your computer, run your first example<br>
Flash the firmware to the main board via FT232RL FTDI USB To TTL Module.</p>
